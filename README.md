## ReCo-Dataset
This is the offical repository for **Re**sidential **Co**mmunity Layout Planning (**ReCo**) Dataset

Detailed information for our dataset please see our article preprint at arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04678

Our dataset is under the [CC BY-NC-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

ReCo dataset is designed for Community Layout Planning tasks which is one of the three typical tasks of layout planning.

Three typical tasks of layout planning from fine- to coarse-grained (the projection relationship in the figure is for illustration only).

### Generating 2D image data from ReCo Dataset
1. Please download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/fdudsde/reco-dataset and put the JSON file under the main directory.
2. Please make sure that the JSON file is named as ReCo_json.json
3. You can plot one of example of the data by using "_id" as index through plot_2d_from_json.py.
4. make_image_data.py can help you to build an image dataset from ReCo_json.json file.

### Example of generated 2D image

### Experiments
We redeveloped the code at https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN and used DCGAN as the backbone networks.

We used an Nvidia Tesla V100 to train the model for 2k epochs with a batch size of 128 per sub-experiment.

The training details of our demonstrated experiments are shown in `experiments` codes. \
We used the same hyperparameters in our four sub-experiments.
